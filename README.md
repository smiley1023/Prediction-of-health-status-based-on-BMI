# Prediction-of-health-status-based-on-BMI
'''
BMI prediction is constantly mocked by the media and the general public.  “Is B.M.I. a
Scam?” is a question that most people and the media ask.
I would like to prove my hypothesis and demonstrate how beneficial BMI  checking and
keeping track of your weight in line with your height is for a human being  to live a healthy life. Using Kaggle datasets and machine learning models  of random forest/linear regression to train existing datasets and do  predictions for the new dataset.
